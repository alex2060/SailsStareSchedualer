This is Marne. How can I help? Yes, good morning. I was just calling to inquire how much you charge to shred documents. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred roughly? I dont know. How many boxes do you have, Marie? Well, lets just estimate five boxes. Five boxes? Let me see. And whats your zip code? 34237. So for the amount that you would have, we would have a truck service that can go to you and shred. What I can do is gather some contact information and have them call you back for a quote for five boxes, and then you can schedule a day for them to come out if thats okay. Well, Im right here off of Fruitville. I could actually bring it to your business. Do you not do it on site? It is a drop-off at the UPS where youre trying to call. So if you go there, you could take up to 90 pounds. It just depends how much youre going to shred, actually, because five boxes is 150 pounds of paper. If you have that much, a truck is a good option. If you have under 90 pounds of paper, then that UPS store would be your best bet as well. Okay. All right. Well, let me call you back. All right? Yes. Absolutely."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Yes, hi. I wanted to see, to get a quote for some shredding up for papers I have. Yeah, how many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? I dont have boxes. I have about six large black garbage bags. Okay, and the zip code where they would be? 08535. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that goes to you and shreds. What I could do is gather some contact information and have the shredders call you back with pricing and available dates, if thats okay. My brother just said forget it. Thank you anyway."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi, I was just calling to find out a general price for shredding. I have a few, like, file boxes that were my dads and he passed away, so I just need to have the information shredded. Yeah, absolutely. Roughly how many boxes of paper would you need to shred? I think there is five file boxes, two that are a little bit longer and three that are a little shorter. So two large boxes and three regular? Whats the zip code where everything would be? 28304. So for the amount that you have, we offer a truck service that can go to you and shred. It looks like this shredder can go out for $155. That would cover up to 270 pounds worth of paper to be shred for that price. Oh, wow. No, this is probably not even that weight. So, all right, I didnt realize it would be that much. I thought it would have been significantly less. Is there an option of, like, is it cheaper if it would be brought in? At the UPS, sir, they can charge you per pound over there to do so. Would you like me to transfer you over there for rates and procedures before you go? Sure. Absolutely.
