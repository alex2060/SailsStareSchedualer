"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? My name is Virginia Jacobson. Hey, Im in Florida, Northport, and I see youve got a listing in a UPS store close to me to where I could get a large box of business papers shredded. Is that true? Yeah, absolutely. You could take up to 90 pounds of paper to them. It is drop-off, and theyll charge you per pound to do so. Otherwise, we offer truck services that can go to you and Shred on-site if thats what youre also needing. Okay, lets get some information. Let me write this down if you dont mind, please. So UPS is a drop-off, and they wont do it in front of me, so its per pound. And then if our truck services go to you and Shred, I dont have their pricing in front of me. I would have to gather some contact information. And then they would call you back with pricing and available dates to do that for you. Okay. Could you do that for me? Because Id like to see the stuff shredded in front of me to make sure that I dont have any possible issues. So one box worth of paper youre going to Shred, correct? Yeah. All right, perfect. You know, I could say 90 pounds just because I dont know how much the paper weighs. Okay, and then the best callback number? 517-281-1668, and Ill have to give you my address. Give that to the Shredders if you decide to work with them. The last thing I would need is your email, please. Okay, its O-D-Y-S-S-E-Y-927 at earthlink.net. Does that spell Odyssey927 at earthlink.net? Yes, sir. Thank you. Now, question, Im in Northport, Florida. Yeah, correct. Okay, all right. Whats the zip code there, sorry, where you do need service? 34291. 9191, yeah, perfect. So what Ill do is Ill go ahead and email you right now the Shredders phone number so you know whos going to be calling you with pricing, and itll ask you to rate my service. If you have a second, I would appreciate you, and I hope you have a great week. You too. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye. Bye."",""Sure. This is Kayla. Hey, Kayla. My name is Cheryl Powers and I live in Keller, Texas. Yall have been here one other time a few years ago, but Im getting ready to move. And I have two plastic tubs. Ones not real big. The other one, I mean, I guess you would say they were large though. And a computer. And I was just wondering, could you just kind of give me a quote on what that would be? Yeah, how big are those bins? One is around, hang on, let me go out to the garage. I mean, I carried them out to the garage. Okay. Is it like one of those 64 gallon little trash bins, like the little cylindrical ones? No, just a second. Okay. So its like you pack your Christmas stuff in. One is black with a yellow top, like you get at Home Depot. Its like a 27 gallon or like a 32 gallon, does it say on the sticker on the side? Let me see here. Im moving them. It doesnt. It doesnt say that I can tell, but theyre- Theyre about two feet long, you think? Yes, at least. Yeah. Okay. And what zip code are you in? 76248. 76248. All right. Let me see what Ive got for you. But first I need to ask you something else. Do yall destroy the computer too? Yeah. So let me see if we have a truck that will do both. Okay. So unfortunately, we do not have a truck in that area who will do both. So it would have to be separate. But I do have a truck for the paper. Theyll take anywhere from one to nine copy paper boxes. It sounds like you have about four for a flat rate of 155 to come on site and do that. Okay. That would be fine. Whats a good email address for you, Cheryl? Okay. Well, yall have it, but Ill give it to you again because I get stuff from you every day practically. Oh, you do? Okay. Let me look at my system then. One moment. No, I can give it to you if you want me to. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Its Cheryl, S-H-E-R-R-Y-L-J-P at gmail.com. J-P? Yes, maam. At gmail.com. Okay. Perfect. And whats the address where the truck will be coming? 4-0-2, Mineral Springs Court. Monroe? No, Mineral. M-I-N-E-R. Hang on. A-L? A-L, yeah. Mineral. Like a mineral, you know. Okay. Mineral. And what was the rest of it? Mineral Springs Court. Okay. Perfect. All right. If you want to hold the line one moment, I will get you over to the scheduling team. Okay. And then Ill send you the address. Ill send you that follow-up email with the direct phone number for the truck. That way, if you need it in the future. Okay. Go ahead and tell me how you spell Mineral. Lets be sure youve got that right. M-I-N-E-R-A-L. Thats right. And then be sure the Mineral Springs Court, if the courts not on there, itll text you somewhere else. So that sounds good. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much. All right. Perfect.

Yes, hi, good morning. Im calling to find out if you provide law enforcement shredding, uniform shredding services in New York. Let me take a look. I almost certainly do. I think the provider that we have that does do that typically wants everything, like, palletized and shipped out. So I can double-check and see if I have someone, but usually the one that we do have that destroys, like, uniforms, does that. Whats your zip code? And Ill take a look and see what I have. 10045. And how many uniforms do you have? I have six. I think theyre 95-gallon totes full. Okay, so lets see. I wont be able to ship them out. Okay. Thats okay, I understand. I know thats kind of, like, tedious. Yeah, so the only provider in that area, they require it to be shipped out. I dont have any other ones in that area that can do that without having to have it shipped. Im sorry. No, okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Youre welcome. Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Katerina. Can I help you? Hi, yes. Do you have service in Tolland? Im almost certain we do. Do you mind giving me your zip code real quick and Ill take a look? Sure. 06084. 06084. Let me just take a quick look. Yeah, it looks like we do. How many boxes did you have to shred or bags? Um, I thats the thing. I dont know. I was actually looking for like, one of those recycle bins. You know, like in the office, you put you put the paper in the slot. Do you rent those for me, Phil, and then somebody comes to pick up? Or do they have to be in boxes? No, it could be that would be like an ongoing service what youre describing. More basically, the truck just comes out like monthly or weekly, however often you need. Theyll just drop off a bin. Is it for an office or like a home business? Um, its I work from home. So, um, so yeah, but I really I wanted it for, you know, maybe like a one time clean out of of everything. So I didnt know if that was an option. Okay, you just want like a bin dropped off to fill up. Okay. Um, yeah, let me let me take a quick look and see. What? We can do. Ill call the provider in your area and just double check and make sure that they would drop off a bin. Um, whats your first and last name? Sure. Its Amy Hathaway. H-A-T-H-E-W-A-Y. Okay, and then a good email for you? Sure. Its ahathaway01 at gmail.com. And then these bins would be dropped off at your house, correct? Yes. Okay, Im going to put you on a brief hold and ask this provider. If they if theyre able, because usually they do that for businesses. But Im going to call them and explain that you kind of work from home and see if theyre able to drop off a bin at your at your residence. Okay. Yeah, if you can just get me a quote, thatd be great.

Thank you. Well return to your call shortly. Legal Shred. Good morning. Hi, this is Katerina at Shred Nations. I just have a quick question for you guys. I have a potential customer and they would like she worked from home and she wants a bin dropped off at her house so she can clean out like her home office. Is that something you guys do? Whats the zip code for the location? Its in Talland. Its 06084. Okay. You mean like a bin rental youre saying, right? Yeah. Yeah, she doesnt want a monthly service, though. She just wants, like, a one-time drop-off so she can clean out her office at her house. Well, we do one-time shredding, but we dont do bin rental or bin drop-off. Okay. Okay. All right. Just so I double-check. Sometimes theres providers that do that. But Ill just explain to her it needs to be in boxes, and then Ill email it over to you guys if she agrees. Okay? Yeah, boxes or bags. I mean, but we dont drop off of it and come back later. Lets see. Everythings done in one shot. Okay. Ill make sure I clarify that. Thank you. No problem. Take care. Bye. You too, buddy. Okay. Sorry about that. So it looks like they dont drop off bins unless its, like, a contract. Like, youd have to have, like, a monthly service. So they said they can come and pick up all the paper if you are able to gather it all together and just have it, you know, all ready to go. I mean, it doesnt have to be in boxes. It can be in bags, like trash bags. Okay. But, yeah, and then they can come pick it up. But they just dont drop off bins. Okay. Is there a direct line for them? So, like, when Im done doing this, I can give them a call or should I call you? Just call this number back and then well get you connected with them. Okay. Once we get a box count. Because all we need on our end to send it over to them is just a box count from you. So they kind of have an idea of, like, you know, how to quote you accordingly. Sure. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah. Not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Good morning, Kayla. My name is James DeDonna.
