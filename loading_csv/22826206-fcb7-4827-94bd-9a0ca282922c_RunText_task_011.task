"{""text"":[""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Yeah, Kayla, my name is Lloyd Ternus. You called me a few minutes ago. Oh, yeah. Here, let me see if I can get you pulled up. Give me one second. Sure. And how many boxes do we have? Oh, God, I dont know. I mean, Ive still got to continue boxing them up for many, like at least 20. All right. So is that going to be your best estimate? Well, it is for now. I mean, until theyre boxing, I can give you an exact amount. Okay. Lets see here. So you want to get a quote for 20? Is that how much youll think youll have at the end? Yeah. And I would guess each one of them is probably, I dont know, 25 pounds maybe. Okay. Perfect. Theyre like bankers boxes? Yeah. Okay. And theyre at a business location in Salem? Yes. 1-0-1-9-7-0. All right. Let me see what I got for a truck. Nice. It looks like I do have three trucks that service the area. So youll get three quotes. You can go with whichever ones best for your budget as well as your schedule. Youll get two on-site quotes. Theyll come and shred on-site. And then one off-site quote. Theyll pick up the documents, shred them at their facility, and provide you with a certificate of destruction. That way you can kind of see what both of those prices look like. And the only thing I need is a good e-mail address, please, for the quotes. Sure. The e-mail address is L as in Larry, G as in girl, and then my last name, Ternes, T-E-R-N-E-S, at gmail.com. All right. Awesome. I will go ahead and get this over to the trucks. Theyll contact you directly for the quotes. Lets see. Okay. Perfect. And then Ill send you a follow-up e-mail with the contact information for each of them. That way if you need it in the future, you have it. And at the bottom of that e-mail, theres a little portion to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. That would be great. Let me ask you one other question. I presume, irrespective of what method is used, I need to get all the boxes down to the ground floor. Is that correct? Im not getting any help in moving them. Is that correct? I dont see any notes here that they dont do stairs, so they might be helping you. They might be able to do that. Okay. All right. All right. Well, Ill wait to hear from them. All right. Thank you very much. Absolutely. You have a great day. Thank you, too. Bye now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi, I found this phone number connected to the UPS store at 1783 Forest Drive. Yeah, if youre trying to drop off. Am I speaking to the right person? If youre trying to drop off documents to Shred, I could transfer you over there before you go. Oh, okay. I think I called the wrong number. Yeah, I have to talk to the UPS store. Let me get you there. Hold the line. Awesome. Thank you."",""Hi, this is Katarina at Shred Nations. Can I help you? Yeah, Im just wondering, I wanted to get a box of paper shredded and I was going to, I kind of was doing it online, but I was going to drop at the UPS store on 120th. Do I just go in and do that or do I have to make an appointment to do it? So how many boxes do you have? Its just one box of papers. Okay, let me take a look. So yeah, your best option would probably, no, youre okay. Your best option would probably be the UPS store. Its a drop-off location. Yeah, thatd probably be your best option. What was your question? Im sorry. You know, if I can just go in there to the UPS store and just drop off the box or, because I know that the Shred Nation is at UPS store, but its not Shred Nation, so Im confused. Do I just go to the UPS store and drop the box off there? Yeah, so you can just go in during regular business hours. Okay. And yeah, just go in during regular business hours and then you hand feed them into a locked trash can. Oh, okay. Got it. And then theyll charge you per pound. Yep. Okay, thank you. Youre welcome. Okay, bye. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Hattie. How can I help you? See, I called earlier today for a bid on 500 to 1,000 pounds of work to be done. Can you tell me, did they ever get a price on that? They were going to call me back, but they havent so far. Could you help me? My name is John Sullivan. Okay, I see your form here. Did you receive the email from us with the name of the truck thats able to do that service for you? I dont subscribe to email. Oh, I see that here. So you didnt do email. Lets see. Let me take a look. One moment. Yeah, so definitely it was sent out to them. So, you know, I would assume that theyd be getting back to you at some point today. Would you like to write down their phone number to call them directly? No, I cant read or write because I have a macular deception. Is there another company that I have to deal with? No, so theyre going to be calling you directly. With pricing, it was just, you know, if I could give you that contact info, but not a problem. They should be giving you a call back today. We are in the holiday season, so it is a little busier around this time of year. Okay, Ill wait for their call then. Thank you very much. All righty. Youre very welcome. You have a good rest of your day. You too, bye now. Bye-bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Yes, sir.
