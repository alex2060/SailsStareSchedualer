"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hey, Martin. I am calling to get some information. We were looking at your website and noticed that you guys had some weekend hours and that you were located here in Finley. Do you guys come and pick up? If youre looking for the truck service, I believe they are Monday through Friday. You could drop off at the UPS store during the weekend when theyre open. But for the truck, it is Monday through Friday. Oh, this is the UPS store? That is where we refer drop off, correct? Otherwise, we offer trucks that go to you. Well, we have a bulk amount of shredding that needs done. Were an accounting office. Gotcha. And we have probably 40 boxes of documents that need to be shredded. We would need those picked up. But we would need kind of a specific time because we work right, our office is right beside Marathon. And were in an alley, so we cant block it for too long. I got you. And whats the zip code where the boxes would be? 45840. So I do have a truck service out there. They would give you a quote for the 40 boxes. I can gather some contact information and the shredders are going to call you back with pricing and available dates if thats okay. Okay. What is the best callback number? 419-423-3109. 3109. Your first and last name? Well, it would be for Jeff Fossey. B-O-S-S-E. And then whats the last name, sorry? B-O-S-S-E. Thank you. And then did you say Jesse first name, sorry? Jeff. Jeff. J-E-F-F. Oh, Jeff. Thank you. And then whats the name of the business? Fossey Financial Services. Okay. And then last thing would be your email. B as in boy, O, S as in Sam. F-I-N-S-V-C at bright.net. Ive got to get my keys. Bright.net, correct? Yeah. C-R-I-T-H-T. Ill email you right now the information of the shredder so you know whos going to call you. Youll get two quotes to work with. Go with the best option, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hey, Kayla, I got a question. I have some, oh, its probably going to be about three or four boxes of some stuff Id like to get shredded, like old bills and whatnot. What is the process of getting that done? Yeah, so if you wanted to witness the shredding, it would be a mobile truck that comes out to your location and shreds on site. Otherwise, if you do not need to witness it, the UPS store over on North Conestore Street, they can take up to three boxes, and theyll charge by the pound. Charge by the pound, okay. So I just take it in there, and then what happens then once I drop it off? You would feed it into a locked bin. And then you guys would come shred it there? Yeah, whenever the bin is full, it would be shredded. And then how much? What should they charge per pound, do you know? I do not. Each store sets their own pricing. Gotcha. Okay, so the UPS store. Got it. Thank you very much. Yeah, absolutely."",""hi thank you for calling shred nations this is kaylee how can i help you hi kaylee um i have a quick question when you do shredding can you um have uh the metal folders in there or do they need to be taken out the hanging folders no you can leave any any of the hanging folders theres no hard metals like the big black binder clips but like paper clips staples any of the hanging files if theyre like industrial size hanging file folders those have to come out but just the typical ones that you see like in a doctors or dentists office those can stay in those can stay in okay great because im just going through everything and im saying oh these are all in hanging folders do i have to take them all out yeah no you youll be fine okay thank you so much for your help thanks anytime take care bye"",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Yes, hi. My name is Irene Gendera, and Im looking to shred a couple of big boxes of my home documents. I live in Newburgh, New York. Whats the zip code there? 1-2-5-5-0. All right, perfect. And how many boxes do you have, and how big are they? Well, lets see. I have two boxes. I dont know the exact size, but... Are they about the size of a bankers box, or are they bigger? No, theyre bigger, about twice the size of that. The length, theyre longer, and theyre probably about as high. Okay, cool. So it looks like I do have a mobile truck that services that area. If youd like, I can confirm your contact info and get you over to the pricing team for a quote. Sure. Okay. And what is your first and last name? Irene. And last name is G-I-R-E-N-E. Mm-hmm. Okay. And my last name is Gindara, G-I-N-D-E-R-A. Perfect. Whats a good email address, please, for the truck? Do I have to give you the email address, because I dont want a bunch of stuff coming through my email? Yeah, its just so that I can send you the direct phone number for the truck, just in case you need it in the future. Its better to... You have your email for the truck, but if you really, really dont want to, you dont need to. Yeah, let me ask you this. Im leaving Thursday morning for about a week, and Ive been cleaning out all my paperwork, and Id really like to get rid of all this stuff before I leave. Is there a possibility that I can have it shredded either today or tomorrow? Looking for a service before Thursday. It looks like theyre pretty close to you. The truck does run on a route, but when I get you over to the pricing team right now, if you like the quote, you can... Go ahead and ask if you can get in before Thursday. It looks like you should be able to. Yeah, I mean, I dont mind bringing it to someone. They dont actually have to come to my home. Thats... Unless theyre going right by, but thats fine. I can just bring it to wherever they are. Okay. All right. One moment, okay? Sure. Thank you. Yep. Thank you for calling Legal Shred. Please press 1 for current customers. Press 2.
