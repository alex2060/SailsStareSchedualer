"{""text"":[""Shred Nations, this is Hedy. How can I help you? Hi, I was trying to reach Kayla. She is on the other line right now, but I can help you out here. What can we do for you? My name is Kim. Im calling with Roto-Rooter Service Company. I was looking for some quotes on doing some shredding in the branch here. Okay, absolutely. I see your form here that you would put in online. How many boxes or bags did you have to be shredded? In all honesty, Im not 100% sure. My GM is talking about possibly opening up options for our employees to bring in personal stuff from home to shred along with what we have. I dont know. Can we get a quote maybe based? Based on possibly 250 boxes. Im not sure on what you guys offer, if its a truck on site, if it has to be removed to be shredded, things of that sort. Yeah, we do have mobile services, and it looks like we do have a truck in your area. Would this more \u2013 I guess Im trying to think here what would be the best option. I do have a truck that can do a shredding event, so thats where the truck would stay there for however many hours, and then everyone could bring things in. Or would you want to accumulate all of the boxes and then just have a truck come and do it all at once? Can I get a quote on both options? Because some of it would depend on \u2013 I mean, were not in a rush to do it. Im just trying to get this set up for a start and then current. So youre literally shredding after that so that we dont keep accumulating? Yeah, absolutely. And I dont know if it would be a continued thing for all of our employees to do it or just per se, just the company stuff. Okay, gotcha. Let me think here. So if we were wanting to get a quote for, like, the one-time purge, not a shredding event, I would need to know the rough estimate of the volume, the total volume that you would have to be shredded. Or if you just wanted to start with looking at what a shred event would look like, we could go based on that. I would almost think \u2013 and you go by, like, the paper box size? Because I think we might be at, give or take, if we were just to get rid of ourselves, maybe a hundred boxes. Okay, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. We can definitely go based on that here. Okay. And are there any electronics that need destruction as well, to your knowledge, like hard drives, laptops, cell phones, tablets, or is it just paper? Just paper right now. Okay. We most of the time have to send all of our stuff back to corporate, so. Okay, gotcha. Not a problem. I just have \u2013 I have a truck that does both. Thats the only reason that I ask. But I do have two trucks that could do the service for you. So what Ill do here is just confirm the point of contact info you had put in online and make sure we got everything correct, and then well get that sent over to the pricing team so they can each reach out to you with a quote for the hundred boxes there. And then if, you know, youre thinking itll be more volume than that, you know, you can definitely talk over your options there, as long as we know what the minimum would be. All right. So we got your first last name, Roto Rooter Services Company. Mm-hmm. Okay, perfect. And this is the best callback number for you? Yeah, I could give you a cell phone number, too, if you would like. Okay, yeah, up to you. We actually just changed \u2013 we just changed our phone lines. Everything is going through Teams now, so its \u2013 theres no extension. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. But \u2013 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The 398 is the office number here. Okay. My cell phone would be 816-654-3238. 3238. All right. And would you like that cell phone as the secondary or the primary phone number? I would probably do it secondary because I dont pick it up if I dont know who you are. Okay, yeah. No, not a problem. Not a problem. So, what well do here, keep an eye out, well send an email over to \u2013 its kim.stewart at rrsc.com. Correct. Well send an email over thatll have each of their direct lines just to give reference to whos going to be calling you with a quote for that service. At the bottom of that email, there will be a section to rate our service today. If you dont mind taking a moment to tap the start, its greatly appreciated. But well get that sent over to the pricing teams and theyll be reaching out to you shortly here. Okay. Thank you. All right. Youre very welcome. You have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Kylie.
