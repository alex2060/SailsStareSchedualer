You called me a few minutes ago. Oh, yeah. Here, let me see if I can get you pulled up. Give me one second. Sure. And how many boxes do we have? Oh, God, I dont know. I mean, Ive still got to continue boxing them up for many, like at least 20. All right. So is that going to be your best estimate? Well, it is for now. I mean, until theyre boxing, I can give you an exact amount. Okay. Lets see here. So you want to get a quote for 20? Is that how much youll think youll have at the end? Yeah.

All right. Let me see what I got for a truck. Nice. It looks like I do have three trucks that service the area. So youll get three quotes. You can go with whichever ones best for your budget as well as your schedule. Youll get two on-site quotes. Theyll come and shred on-site. And then one off-site quote. Theyll pick up the documents, shred them at their facility, and provide you with a certificate of destruction. That way you can kind of see what both of those prices look like. And the only thing I need is a good e-mail address, please, for the quotes. Sure. The e-mail address is L as in Larry, G as in girl, and then my last name, Ternes, T-E-R-N-E-S, at gmail.com.

And at the bottom of that e-mail, theres a little portion to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. That would be great. Let me ask you one other question. I presume, irrespective of what method is used, I need to get all the boxes down to the ground floor. Is that correct? Im not getting any help in moving them. Is that correct? I dont see any notes here that they dont do stairs, so they might be helping you. They might be able to do that. Okay. All right. All right. Well, Ill wait to hear from them. All right.
