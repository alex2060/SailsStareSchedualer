"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi. Im located in Sarasota, and I was wondering, my understanding is you are in Punta Gorda. We work nationwide. We offer truck services that go to you directly to shred at your residence or business. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? Oh, gosh. I dont have a lot. I mean, I thought Id just be able to bring it in. If you wanted to drop off, this is a UPS or on Clark Road. You could go there, and theyre going to charge you per pound there. It can take up to 90 pounds of paper. I could transfer you over there for their rates and procedures. That would be awesome. Thank you. I got you. Absolutely. And did you call me on your cell phone? I did. With who do I have the pleasure? My name is Tina. Tina. In case their bins are filled, Im going to text you some other locations so you could also call them directly and just check availability as well. I hope you have a great day. Oh, thats great. Thank you. Take care."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Yes, good morning. Im speaking with Katerina. Okay. And were actually emailing. She sent me information, and I responded to her yesterday informing her I would like the Shredder truck to show up tomorrow, and Ive not received a response back from her yet. Okay, let me see what Ive got for you here. Okay. So Im not seeing, is this the phone number that you called in on? Or whats your first and last name? Belinda James. B-E-L-I-N-D-A? Yes. All right, let me see. All right, there you are. It looks like youve got 20 boxes. It looks like we connected you with Commonwealth Document Management. We do have your email. Ill resend you their contact info. But Ill get you over to the truck now for the quote, okay? Okay, thank you. Yep, one moment. Thank you for calling the Commonwealth."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin Hockenau. Yes, Im sorry. What is your name? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Hi. Okay, Martin. Yeah, you broke off a little bit. Im at Lakehouse West on Clark and Boniva. Whats the minimum amount to do on-site shredding here? Well, we can go to you regardless, but it just depends on how much youre going to shred, how many boxes or bags you have. Whatever the minimum is, I wont have more than that because its not a business. Its just personal stuff that Im going to have to clean out. Would you have like a box worth less than a box? Well, somebody else was saying something about a 64-gallon, which seems like a lot. It sure wouldnt be more than that. No, Ill have more than a box because I have stuff in bags. How many bags? I have no idea. Im not done yet. Do you have a minimum? So the quotes? Yes. So its really going to depend on how much youre shredding. And it looks like you already spoke to us last month. Did you get that job taken care of, Annette? No, I havent done anything. All right, perfect. So what Ill do, I have your email. It looks like first initial, last name at lakehousewest.com. What Ill do is Ill... No, thats not me. Maybe somebody else called you from Lakehouse West. Its an apartment. My email is L, as in Lynn, P, as in Phillip. P, as in Phillip, Walt, W-A-L-T at msn.com. Gotcha. I mean, I havent gathered everything, you know, to put in the bags. But it would be whatever your minimum is to come out and do it. What I will do is since I dont know who called in here on your behalf, but somebody did. Not on my behalf. They didnt do it on my behalf. They probably did it for Lakehouse West, maybe. Gotcha. And this is Annette then? Sorry. Its an apartment building. Oh, gotcha. So its all the same numbers, Im assuming. Right. Gotcha. All right, perfect. Sorry about that. All right. So it just really does depend. So they would give you a quote on how many bags youre going to shred. You tell me how many do you think you would have by the time youre done? Well, I mean, theyre like black garbage bag type things. Yeah, with your best guess. How many of those? Well, one is really heavy. I cant even... I cant even... So you would have one of those, maybe? Maybe two? Oh, no, Ive got more than that. Im sure Id have, well, lets just say five or six. Five or six of those bags, maybe. Perfect. And then whats the zip code where you need service? 34231. Im not ready yet. Im just trying to get prices. Im not ready. So I do... Im just trying to see who I have out there. So I do have a truck service that can go to you, but they do have to call you back with pricing. Pricing. A minimum range that I could give you would be about $100 to about $185 for them to go out. I could have them call you back with an accurate quote now, or you could call us back once you have them in bags to get an accurate count. Right. But then well let you do that. All right. Ill do that. Do you just come once a week in this area or what? Im not too sure of the scheduling. I know that they go there so often, but they do turn around pretty quickly. It could take five to ten business days to put you on the schedule. Ill schedule a little sooner or a little later. Okay. All right. Well, when Im done with the process of cleaning, Ill call you back. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. I hope you have a good one. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right. Thank you."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hello, my name is Tammy, and I have about 12 boxes of documents that need to be shredded, and that would be a box that paper comes in. You know what I mean? So I have about 12 of those. How do I \u2013 can I bring them to you? Do you guys come fetch them? How does that work? For that amount, we would go to you for them and Shred On site. How many \u2013 or whats the zip code where you need service? 4-6-2-0-3. Im at the corner of Raymond and Southeastern. Got you. Out of residence or business there? Residence. All right. So I do have a truck service that can go to you and Shred On site for $289. That would cover up to 19 of those boxes to be shredded there on site. All right. Im going to do some price checking. Is that the best price you can give? Yeah, correct. Okay. I might be calling you back to \u2013 Im assuming Id have to schedule. Is that correct? Yeah, correct. Definitely. It could take 5 to 10 business days, a little sooner, a little later. And then were leaning next week into a holiday, so it just depends on the time they may have. I get it. Okay. Well, I might be calling you back. I appreciate you. Absolutely. Hope you have a good one. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hi, Kayla. My name is Jennifer McElroy, and I was calling to see how your shredding works. Yeah. How many boxes of bags do you have? I probably have two large bags. Okay. So if you have 90 pounds or less and you do not need to witness the shredding, you can take it to the UPS store, your local UPS store. Otherwise, with us, we offer a mobile truck service that comes out to your location. Okay. And how much does that cost? Thats typically between $100 to $180. Thats what I want to do. Okay. All right. So two of the larger, like the big black lawn leaf bags? Yeah. Okay. And what zip code are those in? 08534. 08534. 08534. Cool. And theyre out of residence. All right. So I do have a mobile truck that services the area, but they will only come out for four boxes or more. Do you have any maybe like friends or family, neighbors, anything that would be able to bring over some boxes as well so that you would have a total of four? Probably not. So can I bring it to you? Yeah, you can bring it into the UPS store, yeah. The UPS store, I have to put the stuff in the thing, and they dont shred it when I know. So I dont really want to use it. So thats all I can do. Unfortunately, unless you had four boxes or more. Well, I can make it into four boxes. Okay. So just know that youll be paying for four boxes. But yeah, I can go ahead and get this over to them and have the pricing team. They can call you back. What is your first and last name? Jennifer McElroy, M-C-L-R-O-Y. M-N-I-F-E-R? Correct. Okay. And then your last name? And its M-C, capital E, L-R-O-Y. L-R-O-Y. And then a good email address, please, for the truck. Jennifer McElroy, 829 at gmail.com. My preferred communication is text. Okay. M-C-E-L-R-O-Y. And then what was the numbers at the end of that? 8-9 at gmail. 8-9 at gmail. Okay, perfect. Ill go ahead and get this over to them. Theyll be reaching out to you directly for that quote. And then Ill send you a follow-up email right now with the contact information for the truck, just in case you need that in the future. Okay. And if you dont mind, I did just send you a quick text as well, just to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. Pardon me? I said if you could click five stars, it would make my day. Okay. Thank you. All right. Youre the best, Jennifer. You have a good one, okay? You too. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
