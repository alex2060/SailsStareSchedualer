"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi. Yes, Im calling from the Georgia Department of Community Supervision. Im calling to see if you all offer shredding for state agencies or government agencies. We do not. Are you bidding on the job? No, no, no. We just wanted to. Years ago, we used to have community service workers that worked at the shredding locations, and I could not figure out which one it is. And now we are moving an office, and we just have a large load to shred, and I wanted to see if we could bring documents there. Gotcha. This is a drop-off at the UPS, or youre trying to call, but we offer truck services that can go to you and shred on-site, if thats maybe what you were looking for. No, I was looking for a location that had, like, the shreds been on-site. Gotcha. I guess that would be, you know. Sorry, Im going through this. This is the old Alabama Road location, though? Thats just an office space for us, correct, yeah, but we mainly offer mobile services that go to you and shred. I got you. Okay, okay. I certainly appreciate it. Thank you so much. Hope you have a good one."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hey, I just had a quick question. I saw you online, saw the business online, and I have some shredding that I need. Is that just something I can bring directly to you, or is this like pickup only? We offer truck services that go to you directly, but if you head to this address, it would be a drop-off at the UPS store. They would charge you per pound over there to do so. I can transfer you there for exact rates and procedures. No, thats okay. Which UPS would that be? Actually, youre calling the Surge Speedy on Old Windsor Road, so I could transfer you to this location to get their rates and procedures. Otherwise, the truck can go to you as well. Okay. All right. No, thank you. Have a good one. Have a good one."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, I just got a call from someone in your office. I put in a quote for getting some shredding done, and it said you need more information. Yeah, hey, Jay, hopefully youre doing well. How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? About three to four. Three to four. Let me see what we have. And youre in zip code 78006? Right. For the amount that you have, I do have a truck that can go to you and shred on site for $195. I could have them call you back with scheduling if that works. Is there a place I can take it? I understood the UPS store in town. Thats where you could drop off is at the UPS, and they have their own rates per pound. I could get you on over there before you go. Okay. All right, Ill get you on over to the one thats on Bandero Road, and then Ill text you another location just in case so you could also call them directly. Okay, that would be perfect. Thank you. All right, take care."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Good morning, Kayla. My name is James DeDonna. I have some files to be shredded, eight boxes. Yeah, how many boxes? Eight? Eight. Okay, let me see what I got for you here. Okay, so eight boxes. And what zip code are those in? 33914. 33914. All right, cool. And are they at a business location or residence? Theyre at a residence, but theyre business files. Okay, cool. Let me see what I got for you. So unfortunately, it looks like I do not have a mobile truck that services the area. But if youd like, I can confirm your contact info and have my sales team look into this a little bit further. Thank you."",""Hi, this is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Yes. We have quite a bit of documents here, and were wanting some information about getting them shredded. Okay. Yeah. How many boxes do you have? And I could kind of go over what your options would be. We have those banker boxes, and we have 35 of them. Okay. And are these at a business or a residence? Business. Okay. Could you confirm your zip code for me, please? 47129. Thank you. And you said 35 boxes. Whats the name of the business, please? St. Anthony Catholic Church. Thank you. And then your first and last name? Mary Motherwell. Motherwell, is this how it sounds? M-O-S-T-H-E-L-L-E. M-O-S-T-H-E-R-W-E-L-L? Yes. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Let me just take a quick peek and see what we have in your area. Do you have a good email, Mary? Yes. Its business at stanthony-clarksville.org. And St. Anthony is S-T-Anthony. Oh, okay. Im glad you clarified that. Because I definitely didnt put that in there. So, stanthony-clarksville.org. Okay. Yes. Business at stanthony-clarksville.org. Yep. Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. So, I have actually two separate providers that route your particular area in Clarksville. So, Im going to send this information over and theyll reach out to you to give you a quote for the 35 boxes that you have. Okay. Just to confirm, do you have the longer boxes, like the 24-inch boxes, or are they just the 15-by-12-inch boxes? Theyre just standard size. Okay. Just the standard bankers box. Okay. All right. And then, are you okay with getting quotes for both on-site and off-site shredding? They both involve a truck coming out, but the only difference is one of the services would have a truck come out, pick everything up, and then they would shred it at their warehouse and then give you a certificate of destruction. Either way. Whatevers the least expensive. Its nothing. Its just old bank documents, that kind of stuff. Okay. Yeah, I think usually the off-site quotes are generally a little bit less costly than the on-site. So, Ill get you quotes for both. That way you kind of have something to compare it with, okay? Yes. Is this the best number to reach you at, Mary? 812-282-2290, and Im extension 2. Okay, great. All right. Im going to get this sent over. Do you have any other questions? No. Do you know when Ill hear something back? Theyre pretty good about calling, like, almost immediately. I would say within at least 30 minutes after we get off the phone. I just send it over to them. Everything we just discussed, Ill send it to them via email. They kind of review it, and then they reach out to give you, like, a formal quote. But Ill make sure to send you an email with their direct contact information, just in case you dont hear anything, okay? Okay. Yeah, because Im going to be in a meeting this morning for a couple of hours, or at least an hour. So, if Im not at my desk, I just want to be able to reach back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ill send you their contact information in your email. That way you can reach out to them if you miss them while youre in the meeting, okay? Thank you. Yeah, not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.""],""Prompt"":[""DEFINITION: Did the agent use helpful language and show willingness to assist?
