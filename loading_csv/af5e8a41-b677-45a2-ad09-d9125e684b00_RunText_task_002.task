I have about five to ten legal-sized boxes of documents that need shredding. Okay. Is it easier for me to just schedule an appointment? You guys can come to me. Im pretty close to you. I just looked it up. Were about a half a mile apart. Those are our drop-off locations. Those are our drop-off locations. You have three boxes or less. Is this Craig Kleinman? Yes. Okay, yeah, I see you filled out a form online. Let me take a quick look and see what we have available. But to answer your question, with the amount of volume you have, it would be a mobile truck service that comes out to you and shreds everything in front of you. And thats great. Okay. So, yeah, so I will see what I have in your area. So do you have, like, the basic, like, 15-by-12-inch boxes or the longer 24-inch boxes? No. Theyre normal bankers boxes, so theyre, like, I dont know, whatever legal size is. I think its 8 1\u20442 by 14. Okay. All right. Let me take a look and see. And you said you have about 5 to 10 of those? Yes. Are these for a business or a residence, the shred that you need to get done? Its a residence. I live in a residence now. Im retired. Okay. All right. Let me take a quick look and see. Could you confirm your zip code for me, please? 80120. Okay. And Littleton? Yep. So the trucking company I have in your area charges $195, and that covers up to the first nine boxes. Okay. And then how much per additional? They would have to contact you to kind of go over if it goes beyond that. Okay. Yeah. Great. So if that price works, yeah. Ill help you set that up. Ill help you set that up right now. Great. Whats your address of where the box, where it needs to be picked up? 6177 South Gallup, G-A-L-L-U-P Street, and thats Littleton. Okay. So I know you said you had 5 to 10 boxes. Are you assuming that youre going to have more than 10? I mean, its possible that there could be a couple more, but not a bunch more. Okay. So just so youre aware of the quote for what I gave you, its $195, it covers up to the nine boxes. So theyre going to, obviously, theyll have to give you the quote for anything beyond that.
