"{""text"":[""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hi, Kayla. I was wondering if I could get a quote from you all to come to an apartment complex. We have a bunch of papers we need shredded, about 30 bankers boxes. Yeah, totally. What zip code is that in? Its going to be 47906. Okay, let me see what I got for you here for a mobile truck. Nice, it looks like I do have a mobile truck that services the area. So if youd like, Ill just confirm your contact info quick and get you over to pricing for a quote. Great, thatd be great. Thank you. Awesome. Yeah, what is your first and last name? Cully, C-U-L-L-I, last name Crump, C-R-U-M-P. Okay, and the name of the business? Its going to be Fuse Apartments, F-U-S-E. And then a good email address, please, for the quote. C-C-R-U-M-P. C-R-U-M-P, at A-L-I-G-H-T, dash West Lafayette. Dash West Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E, dot com. Dot com. All right, perfect. Ill go ahead and get you over to the pricing team now for that quote, and then Ill send you a follow-up email as well with the direct phone number for the truck, just in case you need that in the future.

Bye-bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, Mark, you said? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Hi. Hi, Martin. Forgive me. Im getting over sickness. Im calling to find out about your facility, is it? It would be medical shredding that I need. Yeah, absolutely. Is it a drop-off place? How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred all together, roughly? Well, right now were just using an in-house shredder, but they get tired after a while. So Im not sure to detect the amount. Are you looking for ongoing service or just a one-time shred? No, ongoing service, but were kind of in practice. Weve only been around. Just three years. So we dont have, like, you know, like gallons and gallons of paper. And we were just looking for drop-off services first. If youre looking for drop-off, I would refer you to the UPS store over there. Theyre going to charge you per pound. You could take up to 90 pounds of paper to them at a time. Usually they have you feed the paper a couple sheets at a time into a locked bin, I will say. So if you are needing. Like an ongoing service, we offer truck services that can put a bin at the business, and then they pick it up monthly, quarterly, weekly, whatever frequency you would need as well. And whats the minimum size for the pickup tray? The console, which is the smallest container they have, holds about four banker boxes worth of paper. Oh, thats probably good. And then how often would you think you need pickup service? Thats what well have to figure out. How do you charge then? Do you charge by the pickup services? Well, theyll put you on a schedule. Would you like a quote for maybe quarterly, bimonthly? I would say bimonthly. Bimonthly. All right, perfect. And then whats the zip code where you would need service? 34135. Thank you. I do have a couple. Oh, my goodness. I hate when I get sick. I cannot remember my own address. Im so sorry. No worries. Is it 134 or 1353? Thats what Im going to go check. Its on, I think its 134. Its on Bonita Beach Road on the beach side. I got you. Im looking it up. I feel so stupid all of a sudden. There it is. 34134, yes. Perfect. So I do have a couple of shutters that route there that frequently. What I can do is gather some. Contact information and the shredders would call you back with pricing and procedures if that is okay. Yes, please. What is the best callback number? This one, 239-672-9267. And your first and last name? Wanda, W-A-N-D-A, bar, be like boy, A-R-R. The name of the business itd be for? So we are, dont type this yet. We are at Downtown Doctor Care Corp, but were doing business as D-D-C Health Care. So if you go into the building, youre going to see D-D-C Health Care. Okay. Ill put that here to let them know. And last thing would be your email, please. Wanda at Downtown Doctor Care, C-A-R-E dot com. And doctor is spelled out? Yes, sorry. Okay. So Downtown Doctor Care dot com, sorry? Yes. Okay. What I will do right now is Ill email you the shredders phone number so youre aware of whos going to be in touch with you. And itll ask you to rate my service. If you have a second, Id appreciate you. And I hope you have a great rest of your day. Okay. Im not at my computer because Im just doing light work right now since Ive been sick. But I will gladly rate the call, Martin. I appreciate you. Hope you feel better. Hope you have a great day. Okay. When I get the email, itll have all the rates there? Theyre going to call you back most likely with pricing. So it shouldnt be too much longer for them to do so. The email that I send you just has their phone number so you do know who it is. Okay. Make sure that you let them know that if they dont reach me right away to leave me a message because I get a lot of bad calls and I block numbers if people dont leave me a message. Ill do that. Thank you. But I hope you feel better and have a great day. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. See you."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help? Hello?
