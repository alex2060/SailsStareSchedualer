I was just wondering what the cost is and if we can just drop them off or what do we need to do? Whats your zip code, please? 30040. 30040. So we have two options. The UPS store is a drop-off. Their max amount they can take is three boxes. And thats assuming that their bins are empty. More often than not, they dont have enough room for that. Thats just the amount they have before they turn people away. I do have the option of a mobile truck service that can come out to you and shred everything at your house on a scheduled date. They run on like a flat fee. So UPS charges per pound. I dont know the exact pricing per pound. I know its between $1 to $2 a pound. The truck service. I would have to have him reach out to you directly. I can transfer you over to him to get you a quote while I have you on the phone. Do you have like a general idea? Were talking a couple hundred dollars at least, right? It ranges from like $100 to $195. No more than $200. Thats at the very most. I mean, thats at the very most. Okay. Ill call the UPS store and work with them. If we got to do it in stages, well do it in stages. Would you like me to transfer you to the UPS store? Yeah, sure. Thatd be great. Okay. Im going to transfer you to one on Bethelview Road in Cunningham. Or Cunningham, excuse me. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Yep. One second. Yep. Yep. Yep."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations.
