"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shed Nation. This is Kylie. How can I help you? Yes, hi. I need to speak with a business manager. Okay, what is this in regards to? Its in regards to an existing business account. I dont mind holding. Okay."",""Hi, this is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. Im Jose. I just want to know if I can bring some documents to shred at the location? So you wouldnt get to witness the shredding. It would be put into a locked trash can. Youd hand feed it into like a locked trash can, and they would shred at a later time for the drop-off service. Alternatively, if you need to witness the shredding, we do have a mobile truck service. Okay, no, Ill bring it up. The thing is that you have some personal information in the document. And I want to know like how safe it is. Like nobodys going to read the document? Thats my question. I mean, I dont know how UPS does their, I just know that they put it into a locked trash can. Thats all I know. Obviously, theres nothing more secure than just watching your paper be shredding or shredded. So thats where a mobile truck service would come in. But UPS, each ones franchised. I dont have that one. Its just documents. Its just like a bag of papers. Okay. How about this? Do you mind if I transfer you to the UPS store, and they can kind of go over their process with you and let you know how it works? No, its okay. No, I just wanted to know how well services you offer. Thank you so much. Yeah, not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Kylie. How can I help you?

Is that something I can just bring to the store and have shredded? Unfortunately, no. With that amount of volume, it would be a mobile truck service that comes out to your house on a scheduled date and shreds everything. I could take a look and see which ones we have available in your area, so I can get you a quote for what that would look like. Okay. What is your zip code where the boxes are at currently, please, or the bags? Its 27278. Thank you. And are these bags at a house or at a business? House. Okay. So the trucking company that I have that does route your particular area, they charge $155. Okay. And then the fee to shred is on top of that? No, that covers them coming out and shredding everything on a scheduled date. So all six bags will come out. Thats how much it would cost for everything. Period. Okay. Lets do that. Okay. Did you want me to, did you want to move forward with scheduling or did you want to think about it? Yes, please. Please. Im sorry. Okay. No, Im good. Okay. Okay. I want to get rid of it. Yeah, of course. Whats your first and last name, please? First name is Pam, P-A-M. And the last name is Der, its D-E-R-R. Appreciate it. And then a good email for you, Pam? Is P-D-E-R-R-L-M-H-C at Gmail. Sorry. Thats okay. Thank you. Okay. Im going to spell it back to you just to make sure. Im going to make sure I got it correctly. I have P as in Peter, D as in dog, E as in Edward, R as in rich, R as in rich, L as in Larry, M as in Mary, H as in Harry, C as in Charlie at gmail.com. Did I get that right? Thats correct. Yes.
