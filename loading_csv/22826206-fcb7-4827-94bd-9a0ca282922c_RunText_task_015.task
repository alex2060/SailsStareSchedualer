How many boxes of paper are you trying to shred roughly? So I guess like I dont, I call it like a few other places to try to get quotes. Um, so what, what Im trying to do is theres probably going to be at least maybe like 96 gallon. I know thatll be full. So I just dont know if you, I thought about just getting a shred then, buying one, or if you provide them, that would be great. I dont know if you do mobile shredding or if you just, if I come to the site, Im just trying to figure out how that functions. I dont know anything. Yeah. We offer truck services that go to you. They only drop off in there if its for ongoing service. So if youre looking for like something monthly, but if you could fill up one of those bins worth of paper, thats about 10 boxes worth roughly, roughly how much you think youre going to have, or maybe double that, triple that. Um, it wouldnt. So whatever goes in that bin, I dont know. Its just about, uh, so maybe one of those bins. Yeah. Maybe one is, yeah, because like, well, when you say boxes, like what are the parameters of the boxes? Thats why Im kind of confused. What you buy paper in. So when you go to Office Mac or Office Depot, you buy paper in a box thats the size. Oh, youre talking about that. Yeah. We could also use lawn bags, kitchen bags. Were just trying to figure out the volume, but since you mentioned one of those 96 gallon bins, one of them holds about 300 pounds. So if you end up having two, that could be close to six. 600 pounds. So if youre anywhere in that range, I could have them give you a quote for that amount. Um, so lets do the one because see, I didnt know that you could just bring the bags up there. Thats different. Yeah. And then whats the zip code where you would need service? 63136. Okay. For a business, you said? Um, its for a small business. Yeah. And then, um, Oh, Im sorry. Uh, can you say that again? How about any hard drives, laptops or cell phones at all? No. All right. Perfect. Nothing does that magnitude. This is just all paper. Got you. For this amount, I do have a couple of shredders that route there. Could I gather some contact information and have them call you back with pricing and available dates? Um, I really kind of needed to know, um, or if I just drop it off, what is the, whats your standard shredding? Just for, to drop off, we refer to the UPS stores over there. You can only take up, up to 90 pounds of paper and youre going to have to individually feed a couple of sheets at a time into a locked bin there. So if youre anticipating about 300 pounds of paper, the truck service is going to be the way to go. Okay. Okay. So youre, you just have a shred bin thats on a site at UPS. Okay. I misunderstood. Correct. Oh, okay. Yeah. I didnt know that. I thought you, uh, okay. So thats what youre talking about. Okay. So youre, you just have a shred bin thats on a site at UPS. Okay. So thats why you were like, somebody has to come out to you and vice versa. Okay. Correct. So, um, yeah, because I needed it for my, uh, for my small business and residential. Gotcha. Um, I could have them go to the residence if youd like, or business, which do you prefer? Some of them dont go to either or. Yeah. Well, I needed the pricing for both. So thats why I was, uh, So well do residential. Well, I could just get the residence. Okay. Yeah. That way in case its business, they can also go to you. Um, but Ill gather your info and theyll call you back. Whats the best callback number? 314-786-2821. Your first and last name? Uh, my name is Carmen. Carmen? Uh huh. And your last name? Um, I dont know if Im using a service, so is it just so you can create a profile? Your last initial, I just do need to put that down. Yeah. J. J is fine. J. Thank you. And last thing would be your email. Okay. You can do CJs Cakes and Desserts. Im sorry. My, oh my Jesus, I cant even get it out. MyCJsCakesandatgmail.com. Sorry about that. Cakes is plural or singular? Plural. So MyCJsCakesatgmail.com. At gmail. Thank you. Im going to put you on a brief hold and Im going to get you on over to the shredder for pricing. Ill email you their information. Oh, okay. Sorry about that. No worries. Ill email you their information as well so youre aware of who youll be working with if so. And I hope you have a great rest of your day. Okay. Hold the line please. You too sir. Thanks. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person youre trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. The shredder is tying up with the customer. Ill email you their information. Okay. Ill send you their information now and theyll be calling you as soon as they can. Do you know what the turnaround time is? I dont unfortunately. It shouldnt be too much longer for them to do so though. All right. Thanks. Okay."",""Hi, this is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. I live in Milford, Connecticut, and apparently you have a place on Cherry Street in Milford. And I wanted to get \u2013 I have some questions. I need some stuff shredded. Do I just, like, drop it off? Yeah, so how many boxes do you have? Im sorry. Well, I dont know yet for sure. Im just asking questions. Okay, so the drop-off service is meant for, like, small volumes, typically, like, three boxes or less or three bags or less. If you have more than that, then it would be a mobile truck service that comes out to your house on a scheduled date and shreds everything right in front of you. Okay, so why dont you give me the prices on both that? Im not sure how much Ill have. Okay, so by three bags, you mean, like, big garbage bags? Yeah, like the black \u2013 yeah, the black lawn and leaf bags. Okay, I dont think I have more than that. I know I dont have more than that, so. Okay, so then Im going to transfer you to the UPS store so they can give you an idea of what their price per pound would be. Is that okay? Oh, no, Ive already talked to the UPS store. I got their prices. Are you the same people? Yeah, theyre our drop-off service. We offer more of a mobile truck service. It ranges between, like, $100 to $195 for the first few boxes, just to kind of give you an idea. But really, to get you an accurate \u2013 $100 to $195. To get you an accurate quote, I do need a volume, though. Its kind of hard to assess a situation without a volume. Sure, I understand. Okay, well, you know what? I think you gave me some good information. Okay. Ill have to put my stuff together and really see how much I have. Okay. Yeah, and like I said, if you exceed those three boxes, youre more than welcome to give us a call back, and we could definitely go over what options would be available to you, okay? Perfect. Thanks so much. Yeah, not a problem. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin Hockenau. Hi, is it Mark? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Martin, Im sorry.
