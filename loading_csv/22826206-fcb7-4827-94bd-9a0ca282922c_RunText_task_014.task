"{""text"":[""Thank you for calling Shred Nation. This is Martin. How can I help? Hi, I am going to come by with a couple of boxes for shredding. You guys are open and good to go. The address youre calling for is a drop-off within the UPS, or I could transfer you over there for availability and pricing before you go, if thats okay? Sure. Okay, so we drop off at the UPS. Thats right. Sorry, I should have called over there. No worries. Let me get you on over there. Thank you. I got you. All done."",""Hi, this is Katerina OShaughnessy. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. How are you doing this morning? Im doing good. How are you? Fantastic. Youre located in St. Catharines on 4th Avenue? Thats one of the drop-off locations. Youve actually been routed to the corporate office, but youre referring to the UPS store. Its our drop-off location for 10 boxes in less. Oh, okay. So its the UPS store. Yes, sir. Okay. So whats the cost of shredding? Is it a box? So they do it per pound. Its weighed per pound. I can transfer you to the UPS store if youd like, and they can kind of give you an idea of what that pricing would look like. Would you like me to transfer you? Yes, please. Okay, one second."",""Hi, this is Katerina from Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hi, Katerina. This is Marilyn Kaiser calling. I spoke to someone on Saturday, and she said that someone was supposed to get back to me yesterday, but I never heard from anybody. Okay. All right. Let me see. My name is Marilyn Kaiser, K-E-Y-S-E-R. Yeah, I see you here in our system. Let me just take a quick look and see who we got you in touch with. Okay, yeah. So, yeah, let me look and see what we have in your area. You just have four to five boxes at your residence, correct? It may be a little bit more than that. I cant tell because we put everything in these big bins. So, Im thinking maybe five, six boxes, but theyre not in boxes. Okay. Are they in bags? Nope. Its all in boxes. Its all in totes, big totes. Okay. Did you need on-site shredding, or would you be okay with off-site shredding? I would like on-site, if possible. Okay. So, Id have to call the one provider. I dont think theyve reached that back out yet. Do you mind if I put you in a brief hold, and Ill try calling him again real quick? No problem. Thank you. Youre welcome. Youve reached the office of Rob Schager. Please leave a message with your name, phone number, and the purpose of your call, and I will return your call as soon as possible. Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah, I went straight to his voicemail. So, at this point, yeah, I see Jacqueline did put the notes in. We are waiting for someone to give us a call back because theres no providers popping up in that specific area of New York. Okay. Because someone called me from a toy number. Okay. That could have been one of us. I mean, Im not sure. But all I know is that... Yeah, were waiting to hear back from the provider to see if theyd be willing to take on the job because they dont usually go in that area. All right. So, Ill save your info in here, and then, I mean, when Jacqueline hears back, shell definitely reach out to you. Okay. So, what youre saying is that you have nobody in this area to do this? Yeah. As of right now, no. Okay. I have somebody... Someone else I could call that is local. Okay. Okay. Maybe I could do that instead. Yeah, I would try looking around for other companies just in case because we dont have anyone in that area in our network. Im sorry. All right. Thank you for your help. Youre welcome. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hello, my name is William Keller. Ive been in touch online. I wanted to see if I could confirm some reservations for shredding at my office. Yeah, is this a one-time purge or ongoing services? Its a one-time or cleaning out an office to move. Okay, and what zip code is that and how many boxes do you have? Its 24014, and the boxes are probably about, I dont know if there will be more than 10, 10 to 12 maybe, somewhere in there. Okay, 10 to 12. All right, and theyre out of business over in Renault, zip code 24014? Yes. Like I said, theres probably some online notes. Yeah, so it looks like I have two trucks that service the area. So Im just going to confirm your contact info quick, and youll get two quotes. You can go with whichever ones best for your budget as well as your schedule. Whats the name of the business? Bill Keller Insurance. Bill Keller? Yeah, Bill Keller Insurance. All right, and your name is William Keller? Yes. Okay, perfect. And then just a good email address, please, for the quotes. Okay, its the same one youve been emailing me at. Its bkmail12 at gmail.com. Thats M-A-I-L. Uh-huh, M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. M-A-I-L. At gmail.com? Mm-hmm. At gmail.com, yeah. Okay, bkmail12 at gmail.com. All right, perfect. Yeah. Lets see. I will go ahead and get this over to those two trucks. You will get the two different quotes. Go with whichever ones best. And then Ill send you a follow-up email with the direct phone number for the truck. That way, if you need it in the future, you have it. Okay. And then I did just send you a quick text message just to rate my customer service. As far as it would make my day. Okay. Thank you. Absolutely. Have a great day. Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Hi, this is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Yes, good morning. I have tons of financial documents from my parents who passed away within the last three years. Okay. Is it something that I can put in the shredder myself, or is it something where I just leave a box and you guys do it? It really just depends. How many bags or boxes do you currently have to shred? Well, I have a full box, you know, one of those W.B. Mason paper boxes. Theres 10 ranges. Thats filled with papers. Okay, so the UPS store is for three boxes or less. You can go into the UPS store, but youd be hand-feeding it into a locked trash can, and they would shred at a later time. Okay. Alternatively, we have the option. We have the option of a mobile truck service that can come out to you and shred everything on a scheduled date. The range for the price is between, like, $100 to $195. Wow. No, I dont have that much. Yeah. All right. Ill have to keep looking into it. Its a lot, but its not that much just to throw in. My shredder keeps getting clogged up. I have a, you know, just not a commercial shredder. And I have to keep taking it apart and pulling the paper out, so its a pain in the butt. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Ill keep researching, because Id like to do it myself. Id like to find a place where I can just take the papers and throw it into a machine myself. Yeah, no, I understand. I know that there are companies that offer that. It is within our network. I dont see anyone that offers that service, but there are companies that do allow people to just drop off stuff. So if you keep looking, Im sure youll be able to find someone. All right. Thanks so much. Youre welcome. Bye-bye. Bye. Have a good day. You too. Bye.""],""Prompt"":[""DEFINITION: Did the agent use helpful language and show willingness to assist?
