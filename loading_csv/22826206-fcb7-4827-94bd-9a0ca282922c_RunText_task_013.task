"{""text"":[""This is Katerina with Shred Nations. Can I help you? Hello. Hi. My name is Rubia. I wanted to ask for shredding documents, how much does it cost? Do you have a price? So it depends on a few different verticals. How many boxes do you have? Like two. So I work at a law firm. Its like legal documents where it has extensive information. I need that all shredded. So its like, I would say like two, three pounds of papers, maybe more than that. Okay. But you need a witness to shredding, right? Yeah. I would need a witness that like saying that like all this paper was shredded. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Whats your zip code? Were in Leesburg, 20170. 20. Im sorry. Say that one more time. You cut out. 20176. Thank you. And you have two boxes, you said? Or two pounds? Yeah. I would say two boxes, like two boxes of papers. Okay. Yeah, thats fine. So I do have a trucking company in your area. Im going to just gather a few things from my end, on my end, and then I could get you in touch with them for a quote, okay? Yeah. Sure. But is it going to be hundreds of dollars? I mean, it ranges between like 100 to 195 for the mobile truck service. No, I dont need a truck service. Is there a place where I can come to you? Theres no. And you do some shredding. No. So theres a drop-off service where you put them into a locked trash can, but you dont get a witness to shredding. So once its in the trash can, its like, its shredded 100%? Yeah. Well, yeah. So they empty their bin. Its at UPS. They empty their bins like once a month, I think. Each store is kind of franchised, so they do their own pricing and their own, they set their own like times when they have it picked up. But I believe, yeah, its once a month, but its until a secure, its like a secure drop-off. But I know that law offices, sometimes you need to like have it, the documents have to be disposed of, like compliant with certain laws. So just so youre aware, like the UPS store isnt, follow those. Yeah. I just dont want paper to be sitting there, you know? Yeah. I dont understand. I think, I know it seems kind of silly to pay like hundreds of dollars for just a couple boxes. I think maybe it might be a better option just to wait until you have more volume, if thats possible. Yeah. Ill check with my boss. Ill let you know. But is there any shredding service where I drop things off and it gets shredded? Would you know? No, not within our network. I know theres companies that do. But just in our network of what we offer, there isnt. But I know its more impossible to find someone. So if you just keep calling around, Im sure youd be able to find someone that can kind of accommodate what youre needing. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Not a problem. Bye-bye."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Hi, Kayla. I called a couple days ago for a mobile service to come to my home, and no one called me back. Oh, okay. Let me see who we connected you as. This is Peter? Yeah, Peter. Yep. Okay. Let me see here. Looks like we connected you with New England Security Shredders, that you should have an email from us with their direct phone number. I just sent it again in case you havent gotten it. Make sure it doesnt end up in your spam. But I will get you over to the truck now, okay? Yep, thanks. Absolutely."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, Martin. My name is Betsy. I have some questions about a shredding job that I need to get taken care of. Yeah, absolutely. Roughly how many boxes of paper are you shredding? Approximately 12 to 14, slightly bigger than a banker box. Okay, and then the zip code where they would be? 17078. Residential or business? Its a remote business. I work from home, and Im leaving the company, and Ive been instructed to dispose of the files. Okay. So for the amount of shredding that you have, we have a truck that would go to you and Shred Onsite for $289, and that would cover up to 19 of those boxes. So unless you go over that, pricing would change. Okay. And now, is it just paper? Paper. Can it be file folders? The folders could remain there as well. If they cant shred them onsite, what they usually do is they take them and shred them offsite, and they do give you a certificate of destruction to prove it has been shred. Oh, yeah. Im just talking about like manila file folders that the papers are in. That is correct. Do I have to take the papers out? No, you dont have to. If they can shred them, theyll shred them onsite. If for whatever reason they cant shred them onsite. Theyre going to shred those offsite. Okay. And I would need to remove, Im sure, binder clips. What about rubber bands? They can remove those as well for you if they shred them offsite for you. You wouldnt have to do it yourself. And then hanging folders should be removed because of the metal strips in them? The shredders, again, help you remove those as well. Okay. And do I have to like schedule an appointment for that? That is correct. Yeah. They dont do same day or next day. Scheduling can take five to ten business days, a little sooner, a little later. Okay. And then how would I make payment for that? I believe they accept card cash, but thats something theyll have to go over with you. Once youre ready, well gather some info and transfer you to the shredder, and theyll put you on the schedule and go over any other logistics with you. Okay. And can I call you back at this same number? Yeah. I need to get authorization to expense this. I got you. Yeah, of course. Give us a call back. My name is Martin. If not me, somebody else here would definitely help you as well. Okay. And they would come to the house. Correct. That would be fantastic. All right. And where would be a tipping point? You know, if I would go through and I have no idea how many hanging folders are in there that it might reduce it, you know, like down to... 10 boxes. Is that going to make any difference in pricing? Itll be the same price. So the quote for $289 covers from 10 to 19 boxes. 10 to 19. Okay. All right. Well, thank you, Martin. I will get a hold of my boss and see, you know, say, hey, this is what its going to cost you to get rid of this stuff. All right. Thank you. I will give you a call back. Have a good one."",""Shred Nations, this is Kayla. Hi, good morning. I live in Brooklyn, and I was wondering if somebody could come to me to get my papers that needed to be shredded. Yeah, how many boxes or bags do you have? I have about maybe 12 bags here, but theyre in recycled bags that I get from the supermarket. Like grocery bags? Yes. Okay. So thats going to be about three boxes. If you dont need to witness the shredding, you can take it to the UPS store over on Flatbush Avenue. They can take up to three boxes. Thats about what you have. Otherwise, if you wanted to witness it, it would be the mobile truck that comes out to your location and shreds on site. Yeah, I need somebody to come because... Okay, what zip code are you in? Im in 11238. Im on Washington Avenue between Fulton and Atlantic. Okay. Okay, so it looks like I do have a truck that services the area. Theyll take anywhere from one to nine boxes for a flat rate of $189. Okay. Does that work? Yeah, thatll work for me because... Okay. And then whats your first and last name? I injured my knee. Im walking with a cane now, so... Oh, Im so sorry about that. And whats your first and last name? My name is Gina McDuffie. Is that G-I-N-A? Yes. And then M-C, capital D? Yeah, U-F-F-I-E. Perfect. And whats a good email address for you, Gina? Gina, lowercase, 1434 at msn.com. Awesome. And what is the address that the truck will be coming to? 545 Washington Avenue between Fulton and Atlantic. Okay. Awesome. Ill get you over to the scheduling team now, and then Ill send you a follow-up email with the directions. Ill send you a phone number for the truck just in case you need that in the future. And then at the bottom of that email, theres a little portion to rate my customer service. If you could click five stars, it would make my day. Okay. And can I pay with credit card? I believe so, yep. I would confirm that with the scheduling team. Okay. All right. One moment, okay? All right. Hi, Im Chard. How can I help you? Hey, this is Kayla with Shred Nations, and who am I speaking with? This is Kay. Hey, Kay. Im sorry. So Ive got another pre-sold for you. This is Gina. Shes got about three boxes at her residence in Brooklyn. The zip code is 11238. She has agreed to the 189. No problem. All right. Here she is."",""Shred Nation, this is Kayla. Yes, this is Robin Freche calling. I am calling because in the course of cleaning out our parents farm, we found several barrels of old business documents my father had. And I think that, are you calling from a Minnesota location or are you in a central? How many boxes or bags do you have to shred? Im sorry, I couldnt hear you. How many boxes or bags do you have to shred? Well, first of all, I need to find if they can be. Weve probably got about maybe eight garbage bags full. Are those like the tall white kitchen garbage bags or like the big black contractor bags? I think the contractor bags. Well, theyre in barrels. Its kind of hard for me to tell. And I did look online to see what, is what can be shredded. Its going to be a mobile truck that comes out to your location and shreds on site for you to witness. What zip code are those in? Its 56292. But I need a chance to tell you whats going on, if thats okay. So were not always at the farm. And some of the things are in plastic bags and some are the old-fashioned blueprint paper, you know, those notepads where they would write you a receipt and there was a duplicate. Are those shreddable? I believe so, yes. Yeah, but Id have to just see here. Let me see. So actually, it looks like I do not have a mobile truck that services the area. So another option would be at the UPS store on Adams Street in Mankato. Theyre going to charge by the pound there. Okay. All right. So how do I know if that can be shredded or not? Ill get you over to them right now for pricing and policy, if youd like. Okay, thank you. You have one moment.
