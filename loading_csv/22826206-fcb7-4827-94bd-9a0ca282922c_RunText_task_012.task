How many boxes are you trying to shred? Its probably 10 of the bankers boxes, not the legal size, the regular size. All right, and whats the zip code where they would be? 3-2-1-6-8. All right, so for the amount of shredding that you have, we offer a truck service that goes to you in Shred. Could I gather some contact information and have the shredders call you back with pricing? Sure. Okay, my question is, so youll shred right on site? That is correct. Yeah, they have a shredder on the truck. Theyll shred your documents and then go on to the next customer. Okay, great. Yes, please have them call me. What is the best callback number? Its 678-392-9346. All right. And what do they charge? Thats what they charge. Thats what theyre going to call you back for.

This is Martin. How can I help? Hi. How you doing? Every day is good. Hopefully youre well. Good. I need to. I work, of course, straight from you guys, for Detroit Arsenal, the Army. And we have several accounts with you guys, but I need my own for our department. I got you. Are you trying to set up, like, ongoing service? No, we need, like, the three shredded bins here. Can I do? I mean, can I do this online? Well, if you go online, somebody here is just going to give you a call back. In this case, if youre looking for, like, ongoing service where they place a bin at the business and pick it up monthly, is that what youre needing? Yes. Yes. All right. Thats what Im looking for. So for ongoing service like this, it looks like I do have a couple of shredders that route there that frequently. What I can do is gather some contact information, and then the shredders are going to call you back directly with pricing if you fill up the quota. Perfect. And whats the best callback number? 248-933-4300. Your first and last name? Barbara Cox. The name of the business? Army. Did you say the Army? Yes. Okay. Got you. And then last thing would be your email, please. Its barbara.j.cox79.civ.army.mil. Army.mil. Im going to repeat it just to make sure I heard it right. So that is barbara.j.cox79.civ.army.mil. There is another dot between Barbara and J. And J. Not Barbara. Barbara.j.cox. Perfect. Im going to email you there the shredders phone number so youre aware of who will be in touch with you with pricing. It will also ask you to rate my service if you have a second. Id appreciate you, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Will do. Thank you. Take care. Thank you."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin. How can I help you? Hi, this is Sherry with Allen Medical. And I was just calling to inquire the cost of your services, both on-site versus bringing it there. It looks like theres two options available there. The drop-offs are meant for small volume of shredding. If you have under 90 pounds of paper, but how many boxes of paper are you trying to shred? Honestly, we have several. With your best guess. A range would work as well. Okay, lets say 25 boxes. Okay, and the zip code where they would be? 47960. All right, so for this amount, the truck service is going to be the way to go. What I can do is gather some contact information and transfer you to the shredder for pricing, if that is okay. Okay, that would be fine. What is the best callback number? You know what, this might be duplicated, because when I was on hold, I went ahead. I went ahead online and put in a, like, to get a quote. Oh, did you? Let me see. I got you here. I see your information here, actually. So I have everything that I need. Its not going to pull up for me right now, but let me transfer you to the shredder, and then Im going to transfer you to them now, and then Ill email you their information as well, so you know who youre working with. All right, so hold the line. Let me get you on over to them. Okay, thank you. Thank you for calling Shred America. If you could wait on a brief hold, well be with you as soon as possible. Thanks. You are the next caller in line. You may press the star key at any time to leave a voicemail. To request a call back, press 9. Music is your favorite. All right, thank you for your patience. They are tying up with the customer. When your information drops, Ill go ahead and send you that email. I hope you have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Kylie. How can I help you? Hello. Good morning, Kylie. This is Michael John Sayetta calling. How are you today? Im doing good. How are you? Im good. Thank you. I needed some shredding for an office setting that is in a secured location. So I put a quote out there online, and Martin called me back and asked some questions, which were good questions. I wondered, are you able to call up my email or my request for a quote, and maybe we can start from there? Okay, good. Okay, yeah. I see your information in here. Whats the amount of boxes that you would like to have? It was quoted as 212 cubic feet, you would say, to be on the safe side. I dont know how that translates to individual pieces of paper, but I think we should go with a little bit higher estimate so its not underpriced. Well, actually, if you have 212 cubic feet, I can... Simply just do the math for that to see about how many boxes youre estimating. So if my calculations are correct, I believe its about 176 boxes. Okay. And so this is going to be in the zip code 23509? No, its going to be in Newport News for the offices. Okay, whats the zip code? Im driving, so I cant look it up, but I think its, like, for Hampton, its 23666. For Newport News, it would... Im sorry, I should have that memorized, and I dont. Okay, well, we are zip code specific, so I would need that information if you can please let us know. I mean, you can always respond to the email. Sure. With that information, if you dont have that on you, write this second. But we do have everything else we would need. We just need that zip code where the boxes are. Can I put you on hold for just a second and ask Siri what the zip code is? Okay, hold on then, and Ill be right back. Okay. Hey, Siri. Hey, this is for Patrick Henry Field Airport in Newport News, Virginia. Okay, perfect. So there are a couple shutters who brought that area, Michael. I can send this information over to both of them, and then they would be able to call you back with some pricing and available dates for that. And then you can go with the best option. Ill send you over a text message. If you can rate my customer service, that would be greatly appreciated and super helpful. And then theyll just be in touch here shortly. Is that okay? Thats great. Thank you so much. All right. Youre welcome. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Theyll be in touch. Uh-huh. Bye-bye."",""Thank you for calling Shred Nations. This is Martin.
